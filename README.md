# online_attendance_register

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The IP Adress and many factors have been hard coded so it must be changed before running to avoid exceptions.

A few resources to get you started:

- [Refer here to start the Django local server](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)
- [Refer here to create superuser and to know about Admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/)

Get your IP Address by typing in ifconfig in Terminal / ipconfig in Command Prompt and run the django server in 
[IP ADDRESS]:8000. Visit http://[IP ADDRESS]:8000/admin/ to check whether all are running perfectly.

Install face_recognition module in python3 using 'pip3 install face_recognition'

You are all set to go!!!
